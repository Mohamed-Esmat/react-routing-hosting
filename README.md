![App Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/tawfeer/image/upload/v1695475548/hostin-spa-firebase_pay5of.png)

This is a simple demo application built to practice React routing with the `react-router-dom` library and demonstrate how to host a Single Page Application (SPA) on Firebase Hosting. Additionally, this project showcases the process of optimizing and deploying a React application. Follow the steps below to get started with this project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- A Firebase account for hosting the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy your React application.

### 1. Test Code

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-routing-demo.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

  ```shell
  cd react-routing-demo
  ```

- Install the project dependencies:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```shell
  npm start
  ```

- Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to test the application.

### 2. Optimize Code

- Explore optimization opportunities in your code, such as lazy loading and code splitting.

### 3. Build App for Production

To create a production-ready build of your application, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized and minified bundle of your code in the `build` directory.

### 4. Upload Production Code to Server

Choose a hosting provider for your production build. We recommend Firebase Hosting, but you can use any other provider of your choice.

#### Firebase Hosting (Example)

- Install the Firebase CLI globally:

  ```shell
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

- Authenticate with Firebase using the CLI:

  ```shell
  firebase login
  ```

- Initialize Firebase Hosting:

  ```shell
  firebase init
  ```

- Choose the Firebase project you created for hosting.

- Select the `build` directory as the public directory.

- Deploy your application to Firebase Hosting:

  ```shell
  firebase deploy
  ```

### 5. Configure Server

You may need to configure your server or hosting provider to handle routing correctly for SPAs. Refer to the documentation of your hosting provider for specific configuration instructions.

## Usage

Provide detailed instructions on how to use your application, including any important features and functionality.
